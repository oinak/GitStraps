GitStrap = GitStats + Twitter BootStrap

GitStrap is a fork of Gitstats tuned to leverage the fancyness of the Twitter Bootstrap toolkit.

Please refer to the original projects for merits, I just stiched them together one sleepless night.


= GitStats - git history statistics generator

<http://gitstats.sourceforge.net/>

About:

GitStats is a statistics generator for git (a distributed revision control system) repositories.
It examines the repository and produces some interesting statistics from the history of it.
Currently HTML is the only output format.

= Bootstrap, from Twitter

<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>

Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.
Nerd alert: Bootstrap is built with Less and was designed to work out of the gate with modern browsers in mind.
